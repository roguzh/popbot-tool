/**
 * Git worktree management for the slot system.
 *
 * Lifecycle (parking-branch model):
 *   - Each slot N has a long-lived worktree at <worktreesDir>/slot-N
 *     on its parking branch `popbot/slot-N`. Idle slots stay on this
 *     branch — they never hold develop/main.
 *   - When a chat opens on slot N, we switch the worktree to the chat's
 *     branch (creating it off `baseBranch` if new).
 *   - When the chat closes, we optionally stash dirty changes, then
 *     `git checkout popbot/slot-N` to release the chat's branch back to
 *     the user. The worktree itself stays, so the next allocation is
 *     cheap.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *   - Every git invocation has an explicit cwd (repo or worktree).
 *   - We never operate on the repo's main checkout itself.
 *   - `--force` is used on the destructive path (full removeWorktree)
 *     so a half-broken worktree from a crash can't strand a slot.
